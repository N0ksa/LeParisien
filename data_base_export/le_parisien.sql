Gen. Pat Ryder said the pier should be operational “in the coming days.” The port of Ashdod is approximately 30 miles from the distribution site in Gaza where goods will be offloaded from the causeway, meaning the components of the system should be in position soon.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    On Wednesday, the UK announced that its first shipment of humanitarian aid, including 8,400 temporary shelters, is on its way from Cyprus to Gaza. Cyprus is the staging point for the humanitarian aid that will be shipped to Gaza through the maritime corridor and the pier. “The aid will be distributed within Gaza as soon as feasible,” the UK said in its announcement.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    Meanwhile, US humanitarian aid is already positioned on a ship at the Ashdod port for offloading when the pier is ready, the Pentagon has said. The temporary pier is intended to supplement the aid going in through the land crossings into Gaza. The initial goal is to allow 90 truckloads of aid to enter Gaza each day through the pier, the UK said, a number that could increase to 150 truckloads per day when the pier is fully operational.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    In a news briefing on Wednesday, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of the US Central Command, stressed that the pier was not intended to replace land routes into Gaza, and there would be “no US military boots on the ground in Gaza.” He also laid out how the process would go, detailing the journey of aid from Cyprus to Gaza and its distribution by the UN and World Food Program upon arrival.\r\n</p>\r\n', 'article_1.webp', 'politics', 0),

Only then, all together, were we able to start rebuilding our lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, many refugee children are torn from their families as they flee war or persecution, or are separated on long and dangerous journeys to safety. Between 2015 and 2019, refugee family reunion was a safe route for families to be reunited in the UK: more than 29,000 people were granted visas, 90% of which were for women and children. But more recently, the government’s immigration rules have been failing refugee children who were previously able to rely on this system to enable them to join family members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All too often, government policy is restricting refugee children from being reunited with family members. First, children outside the UK who are separated from their families are now prevented from joining refugee aunts, uncles, grandparents and adult siblings in the UK due to entry conditions that are extremely hard to meet, such as fees that can cost thousands of pounds. Second, separated refugee children in the UK do not have the right to bring their parents or siblings to join them under the family reunion rules. This policy leaves these children without their family, unless their loved ones attempt a dangerous journey to reach them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even where children may be eligible to apply for family reunion, extreme delays in the system can cause children to lose hope and attempt dangerous journeys instead. As of August 2023, two-thirds of the children the charity Safe Passage International supports who wish to reunite with family had to wait longer than the Home Office’s standard processing time of 12 weeks for an initial decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Refugee Council and Safe Passage International have published five recommendations that the government could adopt to facilitate family reunion. These include removing barriers to children joining non-parent adult relatives in the UK, and amending the rules to allow refugee children in the UK to sponsor parents and siblings.</p>\r\n', 'article_2.avif', 'politics', 0),

Board of Education case that found laws promoting segregation unconstitutional, Biden hopes to reiterate his commitment to promoting and advancing historic gains by the Black community over the past 70 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on Sunday, already the subject of controversy amid nationwide campus protests, will aim to uplift the next generation of Black men – a voting group where Biden’s decline in support has been most marked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the Civil Rights era, Democratic presidential candidates have enjoyed wide support from Black voters. Yet leaders of several Black grassroots organizations have warned the president should not take for granted the support of Black Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the months before November, Biden is hoping both to underscore his own record and to reinvigorate the memories of all voters about what life was like under a Trump presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“He has to answer two questions: Why go out and bother to vote, which is almost the same question of what’s in it for me for voters,” said Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond. “And then he has to answer the Janet Jackson test of – ‘What have you done for me lately?’”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a radio interview taped Tuesday, Biden urged Black voters to “remember who Trump is.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“He falsely accused the Central Park Five,” Biden told Darian “Big Tigger” Morgan on V-103.3 in Atlanta. “He’s a founder of birtherism, he tried to repeal Obamacare the first time – now he’s promised to do even more damage.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharpening the contrast with Trump has been of vital importance for Biden as he works to improve his standing in polls.

The president was inspired to run for political office by the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and served as vice president to the country’s first Black president. Those deep connections have faced tests throughout Biden’s decadeslong career but proved critical in launching him to the White House in 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That deep relationship is sure to be crucial again this year for the president’s hopes of retaining his spot in the White House, especially in battlegrounds like Georgia and Michigan – both states that Biden has on his travel schedule over the next few days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I got involved in politics because of the African American community,” he told a mainly Black audience in Wisconsin earlier this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Thursday, Biden met in the Oval Office with plaintiffs in the key Supreme Court case that overturned racial segregation in schools.

We must decide whether we’re going to have a functioning democracy that’s representing all of the citizens, or something less than that.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally inspired to run in 2020 by the 2017 rally of White supremacists in Charlottesville, Biden has not shied away from mentioning the United States’ history of racism – at times being even more explicit about the way the country has failed its Black citizens than former President Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his inaugural address in January 2021, Biden explicitly denounced White supremacy and terrorism while appealing to the country to heal its deepening racial divisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us,” Biden said during his inauguration. “The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And earlier this year, Biden made a pilgrimage to South Carolina – the state with a strong Black Democratic coalition that helped propel Biden to the Democratic nomination in 2020, and eventually, the presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, the site of a 2015 mass shooting by a White supremacist, Biden credited Black people in South Carolina, and especially Rep.

Despite the constant trophies gleaming in the Etihad cabinet, decorated players have come and gone – but six have the chance of securing a sixth Premier League title alongside him on Sunday afternoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ederson, Kyle Walker, John Stones, Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, and Phil Foden have set the tone for much of the club’s success. A victory over West Ham will guarantee each a sixth winner’s medal, putting them level with David Beckham and Phil Neville. De Bruyne was a City first-teamer when Guardiola arrived in Manchester in 2016, while Foden was making headway in the academy. The other four were carefully selected by the club’s hierarchy and Guardiola.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Tuesday’s crucial match at Tottenham, five of the six started. They have been there, done that and donned T-shirts embossed with the word “Champions”. Their experience counts for as much as their quality, knowing how to get through difficult moments. De Bruyne stepped up in the crucial moment to provide the run Silva knew instinctively before crossing to Erling Haaland for the opener, the Norwegian, like all his teammates, knowing exactly where it would end up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guardiola has not kept these six by accident; it is because they have proven themselves the best at adapting to the changing demands at City, setting the tone as they do so. The manager knows the continuous need to evolve is important to stay ahead of opponents. Walker has been required to play as a marauder up and down the flank, someone that moves into midfield and, most importantly, the quickest line of defence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last season, Walker was not a regular but he recovered from his difficulties to show he is integral and was named club captain by his teammates in the summer, indicating the respect he commands at the Etihad. When Bayern Munich showed their interest, despite Walker’s quieter campaign, Guardiola was insistent he stayed, needing the knowledge he provides in the dressing room, convincing the defender to sign a new contract, and he has been pivotal once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ederson, the man at the base, has to be most reliable because goalkeepers’ errors are highlighted more. The Brazilian rarely makes them and maintains his role of setting the tempo at the back, while giving assurance to his colleagues. On Sunday he will be in the stands, though, replaced by Stefan Ortega because of the injury sustained at Tottenham.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It often takes a season to understand the demands of playing for a club challenging for four trophies. Jack Grealish needed time, Rodri struggled in his first season and Josko Gvardiol took months to adapt, but all have been allowed to flourish by those around them getting on with jobs they know all too well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Bruyne has the advantage of being better than everyone but adds a relentless attitude to his honed talent; Silva is a cerebral midfielder who has played as a false 9, defensive midfield and left-back. He is not an expert at any of the three positions, but it indicates what the manager thinks of him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stones shows there is always a way back. In 2019-20 it looked as if his City career was on the ropes, the defender making 16 Premier League appearances as he lost form before being reinvented as the hybrid centre-back/midfielder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foden was always likely to be the most malleable of Guardiola’s charges and, as a Stockport lad, can offer a different perspective. Guardiola’s teams have always had a local flavour but at City there are few options in the ranks. After making his debut at 17, Foden has been moulded into the player his talent demands, picking up a plethora of trophies and individual awards along the way to give others something to aspire to. It is almost certain Foden will outlast Guardiola and the other five, which will bring greater responsibility, but he relishes it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Bruyne says: “The most important person is Pep. The team always takes the responsibility because there’s moments where Pep cannot help us, and we have to do it on the pitch. He created this team, and the team responds to him. It works together.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adapt to thrive is the key to City’s success.

(33, '2024-05-20 11:20:10', 'The Guardiola supremacy: how City became too good for their own good', 'A seventh title in 10 years is proof of how incredible wealth has eroded any sense of competitive balance in the Premier League', '<p>The sun rose on Sunday morning, the Earth completed one full rotation around its axis, and Manchester City won the Premier League title, just as they did in 2012 and 2014, and 2018 and 2019, and 2021 and 2022 and 2023. One more trophy in the glass case, one more silhouette to add to the mural. The greatest saga in English football has been recast as church liturgy, its rhythms hardened into routine, and here Arsenal were simply the latest team to succumb to the myth that there was ever a race to be won.</p>\r\n<p>For City there is of course a glorious familiarity to these rituals now, a muscle memory in those trophy‑bearing limbs, the arms that lift it and the legs that earn it. Of course there is the full‑scale invasion at full-time, which proceeds in contempt of the multiple big-screen warnings forbidding it, because by now it has become a sort of tradition. There are City fans in the lower North Stand who can boast more appearances on the Etihad Stadium pitch than Kalvin Phillips.</p>\r\n<p>Finally everyone gets bored of walking around on the grass, and retreats back over the hoardings. Rostrums are assembled and carpets laid on the pitch. Expectant, beaming families gather in the tunnel. Pep Guardiola takes his bow, clad in some item of novelty apparel that will later retail in the club shop for a three‑figure sum. Then the moment itself, tickertape and pyrotechnics, a large but not overpowering roar of approval. And then it’s all over: back home to begin the excruciating 12-month countdown until City can win the Premier League again.</p>\r\n<p>The problem, of course, is that at some point in the Guardiola supremacy City just became too good for their own good. Too good not just for their competitors but for the competition, for the product and the people whose job is to sell it. City claimed the title by winning their last nine games in a row, but even this only really tells a fraction of the story. All of those games were won by two goals or more, with the average time of the first goal being 17 minutes. Here Phil Foden smashed them 1-0 up within two minutes. We’re Manchester City. Pleased to meet you. Game over.</p>\r\n<p>None of which, we should point out, is uniquely City’s fault. We can talk about the money, we can talk about the 115 charges related to alleged financial impropriety, we can talk about human rights in the United Arab Emirates. But if it hadn’t been City then, it would have been somebody else later. The point is that avarice and bad intentions have always seeped into sport through every crevice. It is in the very nature of sporting franchises to crave dominance by any means, and sporting businesses to crave certainty at any cost. And so it is the sacred duty of rule-makers and governing bodies to forestall them in advance, to build the structures that fix the distortions and imbalances before they materialise.</p>\r\n<p>Instead the Premier League turned a blind eye to immeasurable autocrat wealth, cashed the cheques, bathed in the reflected glory, gripped above all by a faith in the intrinsic virtue of its product, a belief that competitive balance would just happen, was simply in its essential nature. The result – years later – is another Manchester City title that only Manchester City truly care about, and even they occasionally appear to be going through the motions.</p>\r\n<p>The mood before kick-off was one of joviality rather than jeopardy, the City faithful congregating not in hope but in expectation. Emotionally speaking, the hard yards had been done at Tottenham on Tuesday. This was the fun part. Songs and banners. Kids kicking footballs around on the pitch. On the touchline, Noel Gallagher mumbled something into a microphone, and everyone was just relieved it wasn’t a new album.</p>\r\n<p>Eventually the game began, although even as Foden scored the opening goal you got the feeling West Ham were still to receive the message. This is, after all, a club that has spent the past few weeks wandering round as a kind of ghost entity, a largely incorporeal sporting experience, essentially indistinguishable from a piece of paper in a filing cabinet with the words “West Ham” written on it.</p>\r\n<p>David Moyes said last week that his side would struggle to stop City’s under-14 side, and everyone wrongly assumed it was a joke. Foden scored again. Jérémy Doku had a shot from 20 yards. Rodri poked a shot wide. In between, West Ham would simply give them back the ball so they could try again.</p>\r\n<p>Ironically, it was the City transfer target Lucas Paquetá who made the mistake for Foden’s first goal. It was probably a strange afternoon for Paquetá, playing against a team you have to assume he is desperate to join. This is, of course, another of City’s strengths: a preternatural ability to hoover up the very best and most adored mid-table talent – John Stones, Nathan Aké, Jack Grealish, Matheus Nunes – and find it a gilded place on the Etihad Stadium bench.</p>\r\n<p>Mohammed Kudus’s spectacular bicycle kick shortly before half‑time silenced what noise there was in the Etihad Stadium, as if some terrible social faux pas had been committed. Rodri’s goal on the hour started the party again. The VIPs in the cushioned seats started dancing the Poznan, their gold lanyards bobbing up and down as they did so.</p>\r\n<p>The temptation is to see this as a kind of pinnacle. Four titles in succession, a feat never before achieved, the kind of football never before glimpsed on these shores. But then, nobody has ever done five in a row, or six. Guardiola is still the best coach in the world. Erling Haaland is still the best striker. The backroom operation is still the envy of world football. The oil revenues are still flowing. The winning routines are grooved and drilled. We’ll see you all back here in 12 months.</p>', 'article_10.avif', 'sports', 0),

The hope is that the move would result in fewer queues of lorries and less supply chain disruption.</p>\r\n<p>But Starmer, whose party, polls suggest, is on course to win the next election, has sought to avoid policies that could put off voters in Labour’s Brexit-supporting heartlands.</p>\r\n<p>A deal with Brussels that involved a role for the ECJ — presented as a “foreign court” in Britain\'s Euroskeptic press and by the party\'s Conservative rivals — may require political courage.</p>\r\n<p>“Labour has been clear on our red lines, no return to the single market, customs union or freedom of movement,” a party spokesperson said. “While Labour would seek to secure a veterinary agreement with the European Union, any agreement would be subject to negotiation.”</p>\r\n<p>A breach of British sovereignty?</p>\r\n<p>The issues with the current post-Brexit system are well-documented.</p>\r\n<p>A scathing report published on Monday by the National Audit Office (NAO) reveals that getting the checks in place has cost the government more than £4.7 billion so far, with traders facing “increasing additional costs and administrative burdens” numbering in the hundreds of millions of pounds. These costs can be passed onto consumers.</p>\r\n<p>And things could get worse before they get better.</p>\r\n<p>\"More than three years after the end of the transition period, it is still not clear when full controls will be in place,\" Gareth Davies, head of the NAO said of checks on the British side of the channel.</p>\r\n<p>As well as eliminating bureaucracy, advocates also say an SPS deal would remove the bulk of checks in and out of Northern Ireland, solving a sticky political issue — and elsewhere put British farmers on an even footing with EU ones.</p>\r\n<p>But the current Conservative U.K. government has shied away from signing an SPS deal, despite overtures from Brussels. Some Euroskeptics see following EU rules as a breach of British sovereignty, while others suspected ECJ oversight might be the price demanded.</p>\r\n<p>Promising to align with EU regulations in this area would also make it harder to do trade deals with countries such as the United States; its main negotiating ask has historically been that potential partners open supermarket shelves to American goods produced to different — many say laxer — standards.</p>\r\n<p>The EU\'s ambassador to the U.K. Pedro Serrano said publicly in January that while the EU had always been “favorable” to an SPS agreement, there would be strings attached, such as dynamic alignment — keeping standards at the same level — with EU rules.</p>\r\n<p>“Of course, an SPS agreement entails modalities that, well, let’s see whether the U.K. is interested in those modalities or not — because it would entail, probably, dynamic alignment ... ” he said.</p>\r\n<p>‘Fundamental trade-offs’</p>\r\n<p>It is this alignment with EU rules which would see Brussels insist on a role for the ECJ. Under EU treaties, only the Luxembourg court can be the ultimate arbiter of EU law — to avoid rules fragmenting across the bloc.</p>\r\n<p>Joël Reland, research fellow at the U.K. in a Changing Europe think-tank, told POLITICO: \"If you want a deal that is really going to improve life for traders, you need a Swiss-style deal which gets rids of certification and checks. That means alignment with EU rules, and thus a role for the ECJ.“For any government that pursues an SPS deal, they will find there is a fundamental trade-off to be made between legal sovereignty and economic integration with the EU.”</p>\r\n<p>The role for the ECJ might not need to be substantial. Under the model used in Northern Ireland under Rishi Sunak\'s Windsor framework, the court does not necessarily adjudicate directly on disputes. It is drafted in to decide on narrow and specific questions of what EU law means — with bigger questions resolved by a more neutral joint committee.</p>\r\n<p>There are, in theory, also \"diet\" SPS options. New Zealand has a SPS agreement with the EU that does not feature dynamic alignment or ECJ oversight. But it also does little to remove checks at the border, and multiple EU officials have told POLITICO the model is not on the table for the U.K. for this reason, and because of the U.K.\'s proximity and volume of trade with the bloc.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'article_14.avif', 'politics', 0),

National capitals are slowly realizing they will soon be on the hook for a whole lot more.</p>\r\n<p>Brussels is on course to pay out almost half of its cash to Ukraine by the end of this year.

Dialogue is needed now to ensure to minimise disruption to the city centre during the lengthy construction phase.</p>\r\n<p>\"If Dublin is seen as difficult to access for shoppers, visitors, businesses, and staff, it will adversely impact the economic and social life of the city. In short, we need a city that works now and into the future.\"</p>\r\n<p>Mr Sweeney said to achieve a \"thriving and dynamic\" city centre, significant changes were needed to transport in and around Dublin city.</p>\r\n<p>He said: \"Unnecessary transit through the city centre needs to be avoided, as Dublin is far too car-dependent for most of its journeys.</p>\r\n<p>\"However, the proposed traffic changes do not adequately reflect the reality of businesses operating within the city centre.</p>\r\n<p>\"These businesses are critical to the life and vibrancy of the city centre, creating employment and footfall, whilst also attracting shoppers, visitors, and tourists.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Traffic plans must proceed - Dublin Commuter Coalition</strong></p>\r\n<p>However, the Dublin Commuter Coalition said the new traffic plans must proceed, with its chair Jason Cullen saying the measures will improve public transport.</p>\r\n<p>He said: \"Private car traffic using the core of the city centre as a through road is a major obstacle to reliable and dependable public transport, as noted recently by Dublin Bus CEO.</p>\r\n<p>\"A reduction in private car traffic, which isn’t destined for the city centre but only passing through, is also adding to the unease and fear of many people from choosing to cycle in and out of the city which is a relevant for city centre business as many studies show that people cycling, spend more time and money at accessible businesses compared to people that drive.</p>\r\n<p>\"The transport plan will also unlock the city for more public green areas for socialising which will encourage more people to view Dublin as a destination, not a through road.\"</p>', 'article_18.jpg', 'politics', 0);
